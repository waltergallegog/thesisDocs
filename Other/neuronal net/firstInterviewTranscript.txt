CNN visual recog
clasification
applications like pdi

the aim is portable devices

cnn a lot of multi -> we need to minimize energy -> use low power techniques

new dedicated architecture is required
already several works

for example, an array of mac lets say 100 and they have to do all the multiplications (billions)
problems:
- where to store image
- how to move data from main memory to array
all focused on minimize energy


basically matrix convolution and store

on the MIT slides example, register inside each cell is latch

a lot of data and operations, then use:
approximative computing
data compression

Singapore and Polito collaboration
real project with a lot of future
state of the art problem
very research oriented - possibility of publish

28 nm very cutting edge and the best for portable devices, from STmicroelectronics, 

there is already an starting point, very basic and stupid array
in top of it, some optimization
at hw level
at sw level

my job: on the HW matrix
